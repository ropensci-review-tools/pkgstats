Description: Static code analyses for R packages using the external code-tagging
    libraries "ctags" and "gtags". Static analyses enable packages to be
    analysed very quickly, generally a couple of seconds at most. The package
    also provides access to a database generating by applying the main function
    to the full CRAN archive, enabling the statistical properties of any package
    to be compared with all other CRAN packages.
